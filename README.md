# Descriptive2algebraic-chess-notation-converter
This script is designed to convert from descriptive chess notation (Spanish at the moment) (that we can find in old books) to algebraic notation.
To solve the ambiguities, I use pychess library to simulate the board and choose the right move.

## Dependencies
